# KeyframeAnimation_OpenGLImpl

One of my first projects from many years ago, before my graduate studies.  The use case it implements is very impressive, and this project indeed remains one of my proudest accomplishments.  From a structural point of view, I did a good job, despite my naivite back then of software engineering.  It embodies my direct, shortest-path architectural style.  However, on a more local level, my naivite certainly shines through; it is clear that this code was in fact never meant to be read by anyone other than myself.
